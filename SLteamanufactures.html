        Dilmah is unique; a brand focused on an enthusiastic dedication towards tea quality and genuineness, Dilmah also forms part of an idea that goes beyond trade to see business as a human service problem.Dilmah is a Sri Lankan internationally distributed tea brand. Merrill J Fernando founded it in 1988. It was determined that Fernando 's sons, Dilhan and Malik, had their first names combined. It is available in over 100 countries including the UK, Estonia, Turkey, Latvia, Pakistan, Poland, Russia, Hungary, Canada, Chile, Australia, South Africa, Indonesia, Japan, USA, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland and New Zealand. South Africa is the largest nation in the world. Dilmah was known as the sixth biggest tea brand in the world in 2009.

        Tea is the gift of god to the human race. It also has countless combinations and shifts subtleties of the natural alchemy of the sunshine, soil, wind, rain and temperature. As a beverage that cures, preserves and refreshes. This beautiful variety of tea offers both a challenge and a tasty reward, for nature gives us a tea that suits every mood and appetite and calls for awareness and the best choice. This knowledge can only be learned through the love of tea.

        Dilmah 's Founder, Merrill J. Fernando, proclaimed his loyalty to tea in the 1950s. Four decades later, Dilhan and Malik (after whom he named his Dilmah Tea), his two sons, were with him, share his love. Merrill and his sons – the Fernando family – are today almost sixty years old, acquiring the skills to produce tea, packaging and sell customers the finest in the world. Their enthusiasm for tea goes beyond generations for the sons and daughters of Dilhan and Malik, who study tea and brace for a phase in which Merrill takes responsibility for the pact that he concluded in the 1950s, that he dedicates his life ethically to putting quality back into tea.

        In the early 1960s, as David moved to USA, David maintained his home tradition and his family. Upon his arrival in New York, one of the first things he did was find the "proper" English tea he wanted. He found two English grocers, one in Mhattan and one in Greenwich Village. David continued the rituals of his childhood while raising his own family. Having tea with the four daughters was a family value intrinsic to both of them. It was his way of bonding and nurturing to share a cup of tea with the loved ones. To David, taking tea meant taking time: time for oneself, friends' time, and particularly family's time.

        Established by brothers James and George Steuart in 1835, George Steuart & Company today stands proud as Sri Lanka 's oldest commercial establishment. George Steuart&Canada contributed immensely to the growth of Sri Lanka as one of the world's leading producers of the finest quality teas over the course of almost two centuries. The company's contribution to the preservation of tea art and its high standards in the British Empire and its aristocratic flair mixed with the distinctive goodness of pure Ceylon tea has been very important to retain its separation from the rich British traditions of which this company has origins. A SINGLE ORIGIN TEA is recognised world-wide as a tea grown from the lush hill-country tea gardens that transform hand-picked tea buds and leaves into the "Steuarts Tea" fragrance of indulgence. Steuart's Teas return to the age when Ceylon tea thrilled British nobles' senses, vivacious in its full-bodiedness, with distinct aromas and rich in nutrients.

       George Steuart & Company's history is closely related to the fortunes of the tea sector in Sri Lanka. No other business may assert the specialist and personal knowledge of Ceylon Tea People. George Steuart Teas is currently one of the country's leading exporters of Ceylon Tea, offering an exclusive suite of tea goods and value-added packaging. Moreover, the company continues to sell the initial merges as a creative alternative.
