       <h2>History of tea</h2>
            <p id="p1">
                The British took a tea plant from China to Ceylon back in 1824 and it was grown in Paradeniya Royal Botanical Garden (also known as the first non-commercial Sri Lankan tea farm.) a
                After almost two decades in 1867, James Taylor, who was a Scottish planter was experimenting with a new project. He planted 19 acres of tea located up in the hills in Kandy. These creative attempts have made its way through failures and improved over the years. And various individuals and organizations have tried this too and later they have developed of tea processing machines

            <p id="p2">
                from ancient time tea has been a famous drink amoung the local.By 1965, Sri Lanka was the first tea exporter in the world. The first internet tea sales started in 2001 at the Colombo tea auction, which was sold by Forbes & Walker Ltd. In Kandy and 2002 a Tea Museum was set up. Sri Lanka had more than 340,000 metric tons of tea produced by 2013.Recognized for its flavor and fragrance, Sri Lanka is now the fourth largest tea maker in the world and the biggest tea export firm in the world in 2013. The annual production of exports was about 320,000 million tonnes, and the export earnings in 2013 stood at US$ 1.5 billion.

                In the following years a thousand tea crops were opened up after clearing the virgin rainforest, and the central mountain areas were completely planted with Tea in a monoculture fashion. Tea plantation sector in Sri Lanka was around 150 years back. The nation became a primary manufacturing economy

                Sri Lanka's tea-growing regions are primarily split among the major mountains of the island and its southern foot hills. Sri Lanka's tea production is divided, into seven specified regions, each recognized for its unique nature. Everyone has a special combination of climate and landscape.

               <div class="desc">
                        green leaf is harvested on a regular basis at intervals ranging from 5 days to 8 days from each field. The plucking of the soft two leaves and the bud is generally undertaken by well trained women, because of the agility of feminine hands. The manufacture begins from the time the leaf is plucked in the field, and to ensure it retains its freshness, the leaf is sent to the factories from the fields three to four times a day.

               <div class="desc">
                    The purpose of the withering is to reduce the humidity in the leaves and to allow for the production of the flavor compounds. Newly cooked leaves are arranged in a variety of caves and exposed to hot air from below the caves. The humidity content in the leafs falls by approximately 30% during the withering period. The leaves will stay greenish and grassy as the longer garment makes the leaf darker and intensifies the aromatic compounds.

              <div class="desc">
                Fixation or "kill-green" refers to the mechanism by which heat applied regulates enzymatic browning of the wilted leaves. The longer it takes to repair the stems, the more flavoured the tea is. The fixation is made by steaming, fried or heated tumblers. The fixing takes place. Steam heats the leaves quicker than spring, which gives steamy teas 'green' and vegetable tastes while the baked teas taste toasty. For green teas and yellow teas, this technique is used.

                <div class="desc">
                 Once the leaf is siffed through the roll breaker,it is spread out to an even surface and left to allow oxidation or what is refffered to as fermentation.An addtional reaction that occurs during fermentation is the formation of flavour compounds.Fermentation allows leaves to brown and their spice compounds to worsen. The cells in tea leaves are exposed to oxygen from the time they are plucked, and the volatile compounds inside them tend to experience chemical reactions. Polyphenolic oxidase, like theaflavin and thearubigin, is growing inside the leaves at this point. Theaflavins send the tea breeze and shine, while thearubigins deliver the liquor that is manufactured deep and completely.

                <div class="desc">
                    The purpose of rolling is to primarily to break up the leaf cells or components and to mix up the enzymes.Rolling involves shaping the processed leaves into a tight form. The wilted / fixed pellets are rolling carefully, and, depending on their form, they look drilling, kneading, and closely rolling pellets. The essential oils and sapphire begin to ooze out of the floor during rolling activity and further improve the flavour. The tighter the leaves are rolling, the longer the freshness will last.

                <div class="desc">
                    The process of drying removes most of the leaf moisture and stops fermentation by destroying the enzymes.Tea leaves are dried at different points of processing in order to keep the tea moisture free. Drying increases, the taste and life of a tea. Drying also decreases the humidity of the tea to less than 1%. For a regulated period of time, they are usually ignited or roast in an industrial oven at low temperature to dry the leaves. The tea will become abrasive and taste rough if the leaves are dried too quickly.
